# Customer-Support-Agent-with-PydanticAI
**Objective**: Create schema-driven agents for structured customer support interactions

**Skills Covered**: Schema validation, PydanticAI framework, and customer service automation


Here in this guided project, we are building a customer support chatbot using PydanticAI, trained on Kaggle's customer support ticket dataset. The chatbot uses structured schemas to classify user queries into categories, assign priority levels, escalate where necessary, and generate consistent, professional responses.
